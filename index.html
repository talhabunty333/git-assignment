         <p>The Pakistan Super League (PSL) (also known as the HBL PSL for sponsorship reasons) is a men's Twenty20 cricket league contested by six city-based franchise teams. The league was founded in 2015 by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Instead of operating as an association of independently owned teams, the league is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors.</p>

         <p>The tournament was to be played between 13 February to 19 March 2023,[5] However, on 16 March 2023, PCB moved forward the final by a day to 18 March 2023 due to bad weather forecast predicted in Lahore, with 19 and 20 March set as reserve days respectively.</p>

         <p>In the final, Lahore Qalandars defeated Multan Sultans by a minor margin of 1 run to become the first team in the PSL to defend their title.</p>
